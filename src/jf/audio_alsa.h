/*
 * Decoded PCM straight to ALSA, instead of through Starfish's PCM sink.
 *
 * The pipeline's audio path wanted the sound cut into 1024-sample access units, each with
 * a timestamp derived from a sample cursor we maintained ourselves, with silence written
 * into every gap so a missing packet did not pull the rest of the track early - and it
 * still only accepted a short list of sample rates, treating anything else as "bypass".
 * All of that existed to compensate for a sink that would not say where it was.
 *
 * ALSA will: snd_pcm_delay() reports exactly how much sound is still queued, so the
 * presentation time of the next sample written is known rather than tracked. Video stays
 * the master clock (clock.h); this module pulls audio onto it by padding silence when
 * audio would otherwise arrive early and dropping samples when it would arrive late.
 *
 * Format is fixed by the decoder: interleaved signed 16-bit stereo. See demux.c.
