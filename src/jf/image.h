/*
 * PNG decoding through libpng.
 *
 * Why PNG and not the JPEG the server would rather send: the TV ships libjpeg.so.62 and a
 * development machine ships libjpeg.so.8. Those are different ABIs for the same name.
 * libpng16 is on both (1.6.39 on the TV, 1.6.58 here) and Jellyfin re-encodes to PNG on
 * request, so one decoder covers both.
 *
 * libpng's *simplified* API is used: png_image is a fixed, version-checked struct and
 * errors come back as a zero return rather than through setjmp.
