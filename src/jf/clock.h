/*
 * Where playback actually is, taken from the pipeline rather than guessed at.
 *
 * The load payload sets `queryPosition`, and Starfish then reports the presentation
 * timestamp of each displayed frame as the numeric value of a FRAMEREADY event. That is
 * the whole clock: a pts paired with the host time the event arrived, sampled at the
 * moment of the flip.
 *
 * This replaces polling getCurrentPlaytime(). That call is frame-quantized and sometimes
 * slow, so reading it needed a sampling period, a slow-query rejection, a half-interval
 * bracket to guess when the frame had really flipped, and a stability probe before the
 * result could be trusted. An event that arrives *at* the flip needs none of it.
