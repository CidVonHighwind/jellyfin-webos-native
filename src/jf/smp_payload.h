/*
 * The JSON documents the pipeline consumes, written with snprintf.
 *
 * The exact bytes are the interesting part - every key here was read out of a shipped
 * webOS binary or copied from a known-working homebrew player - so they are spelled out
 * rather than assembled by a DOM builder. Kept in C, away from the shim, so the host test
 * binary can check them without libplayerAPIs.
 *
 * There is no audio in any of these payloads. Starfish's PCM sink is not used: audio is
 * decoded to PCM and written to ALSA directly (audio_alsa.h), which is both simpler and
 * the only way to keep a sample-accurate handle on where the sound actually is. The
 * pipeline therefore carries video alone and runs its own clock off the system clock. Its
 * buffering schema still declares both ES lanes: libpf's Starfish load path initializes
 * those controls as a pair even when needAudio is false.
