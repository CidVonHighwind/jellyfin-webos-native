/*
 * What this app ships, and under what.
 *
 * Only what this package actually distributes. The ipk carries FFmpeg, Mbed
 * TLS, libass, FriBidi and HarfBuzz as shared objects of its own, and links
 * json-c statically out of the NDK, so those licences travel with it - the LGPL
 * and the Apache licence both require the text, not a reference to it.
 * FreeType, libcurl, libpng, SDL2, zlib and GLib are the TV's own libraries:
 * linked against, never shipped, and so not listed.
 *
 * The files are embedded rather than staged beside the binary: an installed app
 * runs as a jail uid and reads nothing it does not own, and a licence that
 * fails to open is the one case where "missing" is not an acceptable outcome. A
 * text two libraries share is embedded once and pointed at twice.
